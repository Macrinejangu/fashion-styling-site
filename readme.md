# The Style Sankofa 
**A Fashion & Personal Styling Website Inspired by African Identity**

## About the Project

**The Style Sankofa** is a fictional fashion and personal styling brand I created for my final project at Moringa School. The name “Sankofa” comes from a Ghanaian word that means “go back and fetch it” — a reminder to return to our roots and use the wisdom of the past to guide our future. This site combines culture, creativity, and code to celebrate bold fashion inspired by African identity.

This project helped me learn the core building blocks of web development — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — while also practicing real-world design and user experience techniques.

## Project Goals

- Build a responsive and beautiful website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Practice using forms, JavaScript logic, and styling techniques.
- Learn to debug, iterate, and host a real website on GitHub Pages.
- Add interactive features like a style quiz, Google Calendar integration, and confetti animations.
- Develop a full portfolio-ready website with personality and purpose.

## Pages Included

| Page | Description |
| **Home** (`index.html`) | Welcome page with hero image, tagline, intro, and links to the lookbook and services. |
| **Lookbook** (`lookbook.html`) | A visual gallery featuring African-inspired fashion for both men and women. |
| **Services** (`services.html`) | A list of personal styling services with links to book or take a style quiz. |
| **About** (`about.html`) | Brand story, philosophy, and founder backstory. |
| **Contact** (`contact.html`) | Form to message the brand + social links + booking button. |
| **Style Quiz** (`quiz.html`) | A fun, interactive style quiz with results, confetti, and a CTA to book a session. |

## Key Features

### 1. **Responsive Design**
The site adapts to different screen sizes using CSS flexbox and media queries, ensuring it's usable on both desktop and mobile.

### 2. **Style Quiz with JavaScript**
Users answer 3 questions. Based on their answers, the site calculates whether their vibe is “Heritage Chic”, “Street Style Star”, or “Modern Classic”. Their result appears on a fullscreen overlay — with confetti for fun!

### 3. **Booking Integration**
I used **Google Calendar Appointments** to allow users to book a consultation directly from the website — no backend needed.

### 4. **Contact Form**
I connected the contact form to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) so I can receive form submissions to email without writing backend code.

## Technologies Used

| Tool/Language | Purpose |
| **HTML** | Building the site’s structure |
| **CSS** | Styling and layout (fonts, colors, responsiveness) |
| **JavaScript** | Making the quiz interactive and adding logic |
| **Google Fonts** | Using Georgia & Verdana to add personality |
| **Formspree** | Free tool to handle form submissions |
| **Google Calendar** | To embed a consultation booking button |

	•	When a user visits the homepage
→ They see a hero image, intro, and can navigate the whole site.
	•	When a user fills the style quiz and clicks “Reveal My Style”
→ They receive a personalized style type and a CTA.
	•	When a user clicks “Book a Consultation”
→ They’re taken to a Google Calendar form where they can schedule directly.
	•	When a user sends a message in the contact form
→ Their input is sent to my email using Formspree.

This was one of my most enjoyable projects — not just because I got to code, but because I got to express something personal and cultural. I hope you find the site inspiring, informative, and full of pizzazz.
